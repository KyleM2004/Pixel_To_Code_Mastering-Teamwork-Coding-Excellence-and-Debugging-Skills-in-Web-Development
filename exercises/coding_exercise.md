**Coding Exercise: Refactoring for Maintainability**

**Objective**: Improve the readability and maintainability of a provided code snippet from the Online Bookstore Platform.

**Instructions**:
1. Review the provided code in `sample_code/before_refactor.js`.
2. Identify areas where the code can be made more readable and maintainable.
3. Refactor the code with a focus on:
   - Clear naming conventions.
   - Modularization (breaking down into functions or classes as needed).
   - Efficient logic.
   - Adding meaningful comments.
4. Save your refactored code in `sample_code/after_refactor.js`.

**Criteria for Success**:
- Enhanced readability and maintainability.
- Adherence to coding standards.
- Clear and concise documentation within the code.

### `sample_code/`

- `before_refactor.js`: Original code for the refactoring exercise.
- `after_refactor.js`: File to be created by the participant with the refactored code.
- `buggy_code.js`: Buggy code for the debugging challenge.
- `debugging_notes.md`: File to document the debugging process and solutions.

**Note**: The specific content of the `.js` files would include representative code snippets relevant to the Online Bookstore Platform. These could involve functions for handling user interactions, API calls, data processing, or similar functionalities commonly encountered in such a project. The `debugging_notes.md` would be a template for participants to fill out, detailing their debugging approach, the issues they found, and how they resolved them.
